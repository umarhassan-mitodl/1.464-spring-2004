description: 'These pro-forma financial statements are for the use of Collaborative
  Structures, Inc. and potential investors.

  Please use in conjunction with Investment Summary

  These statements project the growth curve of the Company as a function of sales
  force size, success of the sales force,

  average selling price, cost of goods sold, and duration of projects. These are the
  key sensitivities.

  The presentation is organized as follows:

  Summary Financial Information

  Sales Build: The penetrations and assumptions leading to booking new work

  Cost of Goods Sold

  Selling Expenses (including input assumptions for success of sales staff)

  Marketing Expenses (success of sales relates to effectiveness of marketing effort
  - not quantified here)

  Research and Development Expenses

  General and Adminstrative Expenses

  These pro-formas indicate one possible strategy. They can serve as a baseline for
  discussion of other strategies.'
